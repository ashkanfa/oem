The algorithm works by \r\n\r\n1. augmenting the original design matrix such that the augmented matrix is orthogonal\r\n2. treating the augmented responses as missing\r\n3. use EM iterations with simple closed form expressions to solve original problem\r\n\r\nThe oem algorithm works for a variety of penalties including the lasso, elastic net, MCP, and SCAD.\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\n```{r}\r\nn <- 5000\r\np <- 200\r\nm <- 25\r\nb <- matrix(c(runif(m, -0.5, 0.5), rep(0, p - m)))\r\nx <- matrix(rnorm(n * p, sd = 3), n, p)\r\ny <- drop(x %*% b) + rnorm(n)\r\nfit <- oem(x, y, penalty = \"lasso\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n",
