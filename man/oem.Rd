\arguments{
\item{x}{input matrix or SparseMatrix (sparse not yet implemented. 
Each row is an observation, each column corresponds to a covariate}

\item{y}{numeric response vector of length nobs.}

\item{family}{"gaussian" for least squares problems, "binomial" for binary response. "binomial" not yet implemented}

\item{penalty}{Specification of penalty type in lowercase letters. Choices include "lasso", 
"ols" (Ordinary least squares, no penaly), "elastic.net", "scad", "mcp"}

\item{lambda}{A user supplied lambda sequence. By default, the program computes
its own lambda sequence based on nlambda and lambda.min.ratio. Supplying
a value of lambda overrides this.}

\item{nlambda}{The number of lambda values - default is 100.}

\item{lambda.min.ratio}{Smallest value for lambda, as a fraction of lambda.max, the (data derived) entry
value (i.e. the smallest value for which all coefﬁcients are zero). The default
depends on the sample size nobs relative to the number of variables nvars. If
nobs > nvars, the default is 0.0001, close to zero. If nobs < nvars, the default
is 0.01. A very small value of lambda.min.ratio will lead to a saturated fit
when nobs < nvars.}

\item{alpha}{mixing value for elastic.net. penalty applied is (1 - alpha) * (ridge penalty) + alpha * (lasso penalty)}

\item{gamma}{tuning parameter for SCAD and MCP penalties}

\item{penalty.factor}{Separate penalty factors can be applied to each coefficient. 
This is a number that multiplies lambda to allow differential shrinkage. Can be 0 for some variables, 
which implies no shrinkage, and that variable is always included in the model. Default is 1 for all 
variables.}

\item{group.weights}{penalty factors applied to each group for the group lasso. Similar to penalty.factor, 
this is a number that multiplies lambda to allow differential shrinkage. Can be 0 for some groups, 
which implies no shrinkage, and that group is always included in the model. Default is sqrt(group size) for all
groups.}

\item{maxit}{integer. Maximum number of OEM iterations}

\item{tol}{convergence tolerance for OEM iterations}

\item{irls.maxit}{integer. Maximum number of IRLS iterations}

\item{irls.tol}{convergence tolerance for IRLS iterations. Only used if family != "gaussian"}
